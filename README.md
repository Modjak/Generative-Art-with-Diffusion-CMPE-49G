Generative Art with Diffusion, Flow Field, Perlin Noise

Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set
of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention,
which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in
a completed work of art [1]. We are going to simulate some kind of diffusion here actually,
we will put a number of colorful particles on to the some white or any desired colored page,
and these particles will be affected from flow filed that is generated by perlin noise, and
as the particles move around we they will paint the page and we will have generative art.
It is important to use perlin noise while creating flow filed instead of solely randomness.
Because random() will generate a number with uniform distribution in a given range, so
each call would be independent. Naturally number sequence is chaotic when the difference
between consecutive numbers are big which is case for random selection. On the other
side, perlin noise creates a smooth more natural number pattern because each number
has dependency between previous ones, this is very helpful for generating the flow field
making particles to move in a meaningful way.
